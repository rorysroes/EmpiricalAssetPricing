You've opened up Santana Row\\nand I believe there was some talk about also broadening up the approach to have maybe smaller selling\\npoints in public places like malls and stuff like that. Can you tell us a little bit about like how your retailing\\nstrategy has evolved now that you are obviously ramping it up more aggressively? That would be my first\\nquestion.\\n\",\n",

In fact, most people would rate purchasing a car as their\\nworst retail experience, some regard it as one of those [indiscernible]. So we really want to be the polar\\nopposite of that. We want it to be, buying a car is something you look forward to, that it's a delightful\\nexperience. We want to have stores that you're drawn to come in even if you don't really need to buy a car\\nat the time. And so, we'll try -- we're reiterating, since opening up our first store a few years ago, trying\\nto refine this and Santana Row is basically the latest version of the store, if you will, store version 3 or\\nsomething like that. And then, I think we're really getting it pretty dialed in. We're seeing tremendous\\ntrack record at the stores, thousands of people coming in per week. And while this is slightly helpful\\nfor Roadster, it's really helpful for Model S and for future vehicles that we will bring out that are more\\naffordable. I'd really recommend going and visiting the Santana Row store to get a visual sense of what\\nI'm talking about, because it's hard to describe exactly, but easy to understand if you go there.\\n\",\n",

So we're\\nalso going to focus our energies on ensuring that we're not production constrained. And that's why we\\nreconfigured the plan to make the Model S production, the 20,000 units production, on 1 shift instead of 2\\nshifts, so that we have the ability to potentially to double the production, fairly quickly, if need be.

Model S reservations right now are, I don't have the exact numbers with me, but buyers are\\npretty strongly towards North America. Yes, at least, sort of in the order of 3/4, North America. But part of\\nthat is because we'll deliver in North America first. So we deliver in North America in middle of next year,\\nEurope end of next year. And then our right-hand drive vehicle, which is key for U.K., is only in 2013.
