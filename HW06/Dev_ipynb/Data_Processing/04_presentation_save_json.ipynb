It is on time for first customer deliveries in mid-2012, with a slow ramp in\\nproduction in the second half of 2012, reaching steady-state in 2013. I should say, steady-state somewhat\\nmitigated by the fact that we certainly have the ability to go beyond the current projection of 20,000 units\\na year. So demand is there.

We saw high levels of activity in each limits of the production\\nprocess. First, the stamping line is now installed, and we've been able to operate several of the stamping\\nmachines. And we expect to be stamping parts from that line in the next probably 4 to 6 months.\\n\"], '21': ['The renovations are going very, very well, actually. As of the end of April, we had over 4,600 reservations,\\nand the minimum reservation is $5,000. It would appear that these rates of reservations is actually\\naccelerating.

Our\\ngoal with Tesla is to -- with the RAV4 is to have it beat the domestic acceleration of any vehicle with a\\nToyota nameplate. So excluding Lexus. Apart from Lexus, vehicles have best acceleration. And also, of\\ncourse, to have the best range of any mass-market vehicle.\\n\"], '24': [\"In terms of operational guidance. Last quarter, our primary objective was to execute the Alpha build,\\nand that we did. And it's going -- actually it's slightly better than expected. And as I mentioned a while\\nago, we remain on track for first release of Model S in the middle of next year. This quarter, our Model S\\nactivities will be a great deal of testing of the Alphas for preparation for the Beta build, which will be done\\nin our Fremont factory.

Operating activities consumed $43 million in the quarter versus $34 million\\nin the prior quarter.
